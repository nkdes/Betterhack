# Betterhack

A decentralized hackathon platform utilizing betting as a way to fund prize pools and interact with hackathons. Built during 42 Berlin x Starknet Hackathon.

## Overview

Betterhack is a web application that combines hackathons with betting mechanics. Users can create or participate in hackathons while others can bet on teams to win. A portion of the betting pool contributes to the prize pool for winning teams, while the remainder is distributed among successful bettors. The platform leverages Starknet for secure transactions.

## Profit Sharing

The betting system follows a simple model:

- **For Each Hackathon**
  - Bettors place bets on which team they think will win
  - Winning bettors get their original bet back
  - Second and third place bettors get 50% of their bet back
  - Remaining bets form the pool to be distributed
  - From the losing pool:
    - 80% is shared among winning bettors proportionally to their bet size
    - 19.5% goes to hackathon prizes
    - 0.5% goes to platform fees

- **Prize Pool (19.5% of losing bets)**
  - First Place: 9% of losing pool
  - Second Place: 6.5% of losing pool
  - Third Place: 4% of losing pool

- **Platform Fee (0.5% of losing bets)**
  - Covers operational costs

For example:
If there's 10000 STRK total bets:
- 4000 STRK bet on Team A
- 3000 STRK bet on Team B
- 3000 STRK bet on Team C

If Team A wins, Team B second, Team C third:
- Team A bettors get their 4000 STRK back
- Team B bettors get 1500 STRK back (50% refund)
- Team C bettors get 1500 STRK back (50% refund)
- Losing pool is 3000 STRK (remaining 50% from B and C)
  - 2400 STRK shared among Team A bettors (80%)
  - 585 STRK goes to hackathon prizes (270/195/120 split)
  - 15 STRK goes to platform (0.5%)
- Each Team A bettor gets their original bet back plus their share of 2400 STRK based on their bet size

Note: Betting closes when teams are locked in.
